            Command your colonists like a boss!
            
               The Achtung! mod enhances how you control RimWorld. You will get more control on how to position your colonists and how they take job orders.
                  
                     In a nutshell you can:
                        
                           - position your drafted colonists along a line
                              - move them in formation
                                 - give orders to multiple colonists at once
                                    - force jobs so they get uninterrupted attention
                                       - haul and repair outside allowed areas
                                          
                                             
                                                EXAMPLES
                                                   
                                                      (*) Save time by issuing a command with more than one colonist selected. For example: select three brawlers and right click an enemy, then choose "melee". Done.
                                                         
                                                            (*) In combat, position colonists equally spaced in door openings. Select multiple drafted colonists and with the right mouse button drag a line. Achtung! will move your colonists to equally spaced positions in real time. 10 colonists into 10 doors? No problem!
                                                               
                                                                  (*) Fall back a few steps with a group of colonists? Easy. Select them and hold the configured key to move them relative to their current formation. You can even rotate the formation with the standard rotation keys.
                                                                     
                                                                        (*) Make sure that wall and the sandbags are build before the raid arrives. No cloudwatching or eating allowed! Use the [Force] button that Achtung! adds to all "Prioritize..." menus and you can be sure that all assigned work will be done.
                                                                           
                                                                              (*) Want one colonist harvest and another sow these three fields? Force them to their tasks and queue up non-adjacted fields by simply adding forced work on them (like ordinary jobs but without the shift key).
                                                                                 
                                                                                    (*) Treat all injured colonists in their beds? Select a doctor, choose "Prioritize tending... [Force]" and increase the search range so nearby patients will be included (you will see a small "!" on all forced job). Then focus on other important stuff because you can be sure it's done.
                                                                                       
                                                                                          The original three Achtung! commands "Clean Room", "Fight Fire" or "Sow Zone/Room" still exist because they do stuff a bit smarter than the build in prioritized work commands.
                                                                                             
                                                                                                
                                                                                                   SETTINGS
                                                                                                      
                                                                                                         Achtung uses the default way to access mod settings. There, you find switches to turn certain features on/off and you can change the default keys to your liking.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                  ADDING AND REMOVING:
                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                        Achtung can be added to any existing game. It usually does not modify save state for saved games to avoid a dependency on it. However, a side effect of the provided custom jobs is that when save the game and your colonists are actively running an Achtung job this will be saved too thus creating a dependency to Achtung. Workaround: open the saved game with Achtung, cancel all Achtung jobs and save it again. This will "clean" the save and remove the dependency.

            Enchances pawns' perception of nature.
            
               Simple mod that adjusts beauty and ugly modifiers for terrain and flora. Most notable changes:
                  
                     - flowers are significantly more beautiful now;
                        - most trees have beauty increased to 2-4 range. Oak and Teak trees have 5 beauty;
                           - grass and most bush plants have 1 beauty. Berry plants and healroot have 2 beauty;
                              - water has overall beauty increased to 4 with ocean cost line having beauty of 6;
                                 - soil, sand and ice get neutral beauty, rich soil gets 1 beauty;
                                    - mud and marsh are really dislikable for the pawns now (-4 and -6 beauty);
                                       - rafflesia is adjusted to -12 beauty to correspond its description;
                                          - chunks and stone blocks are more tolerable with -4 and -6 beauty (against -8 and -12 in Vanilla. Ouch!).

            Adds 32 landforms to the game, which generate biome-independently. The goal of this mod is to make map generation more interesting and varied, compared to the vanilla experience of simply having either a cliff or a coast on one edge of your map.

            Extreme violence!
            
               Adds blood sprays, animated bleeding, ricochets, impact debris, and bullet casings!
                  
                     Directional blood sprays (Videos above)
                        *Triggered by direct damage, such as bullets, explosions, and damaging psycasts, and the blood amount scales based on the damage done.
                           *Blood particles last ~10s (configurable in options) and will fade away on it's own.
                              *20% (configurable in options) of particles will leave filth behind, which requires cleanup like vanilla blood.
                                 
                                    Animated bleeding
                                       *Animated bleeding based on pawn bleed rate.
                                          
                                             Ricochets
                                                *When bullets are deflected by body armor, or when hitting hard targets like mechanoids, visual ricochet animations may occur!
                                                   
                                                      Impact Debris
                                                         *When hitting inorganic pawns or structures, debris will fly out!
                                                            *Impact debris follow similar rules to blood spray.

                                                                           *Originally a mod called [Syr] Bullet Casings. It was one of my favorites, but sadly no longer updated. So here it is reimplemented, with improved animations and fixed to be compatible with everything since 1.4 including modded weapons. This feature can be disabled in the options. Credit and thanks to Syrchalis!

                                                                                    Inevitably, extra objects on the map has a cost, but these objects are relatively simple and do not last a long time, and how much and how long can be configured to the point where it has nearly 0% impact. So in the big scheme of things, the performance cost shouldn't be noticeable and can be configured to match your needs.

            Vanilla Expanded Framework incorporates a multitude of functionalities for different mods in order for us to boost performance by not duplicating code across several mods. Examples of shared functionality include custom base generation code with an amazing building export tool, customisable sieges, faction-based pack animal textures, faction based apparel colouring system, Orion’s Faction Discovery revamped and improved, Item processor code, shields, and many, many others.
            	
               	Orion's Faction Discovery?
                  
                     Yes!We have negotiated a deal with Orion and included his Faction Discovery mod within Vanilla Expanded Framework. Now, if you decide to add a faction to an existing playthrough, upon loading up the save you will have an option to spawn it's settlements and define how many of them you would like to spawn, as well as how far away from the player.

            Adds multiple unique new animals to Rimworld.
            
               &lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
                  
                     Adds 100+ new, vanilla-friendly creatures to the diverse biomes of your Rimworlds. The philosophy of this mod is that every new creatures tries to bring some new mechanic into the game, whether it be walking tanks, living resource farm, indestructible plant monsters, night-time stalkers, or plain speedy giant spiders. Some of the mechanics are simple, others much more complex.
                        
                           These animals will spawn in certain biomes, some others will only be available via traders. You'll have to explore to find them all! The Alpha Biomes is a companion mod that adds several new alien biomes to house these weird creatures.
                              
                                 Bear in mind that spawn probabilities have been calculated with no other animal mods installed. If you have, for example, Vanilla Animals Expanded, less animals from this mod will appear, obviously.
                                    
                                       The mod will also add new insects in a new faction, the Black Hive. Raids from that faction can be disabled via Mod Options.

                                                   There shouldn't be any. Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.

            Vanilla Fishing Expanded is a first module in a brand new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. With such an important mechanic missing from the base game, we Oskar and Sarg have decided to introduce a way to catch fish in your local water sources, adding a bit of purpose for settling near running water and ocean side.
            
               With simple, intuitive, vanilla-like mechanics, all it takes is to designate a fishing zone same way you designate a growing zone, and assign your Animals capable pawns to the new fishing job type. In no time they will pull out fishing rods from their invisible bags, head straight down to the river and whilst chatting to each other, try to catch a new meat type called fish, which can be eaten raw (providing an Ate raw food debuff, just like regular vanilla meat), or used in a cooking recipe. Unlike other mods, the fish don’t need to be butchered.
                  
                     &lt;size=24&gt;Compatibility&lt;/size&gt;
                        
                           Compatible with any other fishing mod
                              Compatible with Advanced Biomes
                                 Compatible with Realistic Planets
                                    Compatible with Nature's Pretty Sweet
                                       Compatible with Mallorn Forest from LotR mod
                                          Extra compatibility with Alpha Biomes (19 specific fish)

            ReGrowth: Core is both a content mod and a small framework, aiming to overhaul and improve on Rimworlds vanilla biomes, add new and unique features and biomes, replace many of the vanilla plant textures with HD ones and, in combination with its companion mods, add new plants that fit perfectly into the vanilla artstyle. On top of that, it adds a lot of new weather types, many with custom visual effects to spice up your game.
            
               ReGrowth is, at its core, a mod deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vanilla Expanded Series. Everything it adds fits into Vanilla Rimworld. Every system (like for example new terrain) is designed to mimic how similar vanilla systems work while also being as friendly to your games performance as possible. NOTHING in this mod will absolutely tank your FPS and the few features that do cost some performance are optional.
                  
                     This mod is the Core, which is a requirement for all other ReGrowth mods. Please note the new terrain will only be seen in new biomes that use them, not in vanilla biomes.
                        
                           This mod is as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of code required and every bit of code written has performance in mind!

            Vanilla Plants Expanded is a core module in a plant-based in the new mod series “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team. After hours of designing, testing and  designing again, Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder are proud to present this content pack to help you with your RimWorld farming simulator. This mod features a variety of fruit plants and crops to spice up your fields, with each prop adding something different and unique, allowing you to use the power of farming differently based on your situation and needs.
            
               Adding a variety of crops, each with different mechanics and traits, but still kept within vanilla balancing, we are hoping to give you a chance to tailor your farming industry to your liking. These plants are not meant to replace vanilla plants - they are balanced in-line with those, meaning rice and potatoes will still be useful!
                  
                     Fruit trees are biome-locked to two unique new fruit trees per biome, however bear in mind they do not differ nutrition-wise from one another - which is partly the reason why we decided to biome lock them. We also didn’t want to flood your farming menus with 12 different fruit trees that yield pretty much the same, but reskinned, item. This has all been done with the ease of use in mind.
                        
                           A new ability to plow soil has also been introduced once you meet the designated research. Plowing soil boosts its fertility to that of Rich soil, however when the plant is harvested, tilled soil returns to its previous form and needs to be plowed again.
                              
                                 This mod has built in patches for Vanilla Cooking Expanded, adding new functionality, such as new condiment recipes!

            Vanilla Textures Expanded is a full-scale overhaul of vanilla (unmodded) RimWorld textures, with its main aim being not only to fix less aesthetically pleasing textures, but also to bring vanilla aesthetic in-line with that of Vanilla Expanded mod series.
            
               This texture pack includes over 450 textures remade in vector-based software (same method used for Vanilla Expanded mods), exported into 2x the size of vanilla textures. What used to be blurred before, now will be sharp and crisp, even if zoomed in fully using mods by the likes of Camera+.
                  
                     When redrawing vanilla textures, our main focus was on keeping them consistent with what players are used to - don’t expect any drastic design changes - we have only changed the look of things that were really bad or ambiguous.
                        
                           We plan to keep adding new textures in the future, so make sure to let us know what particular textures in vanilla game require changes!

            Alters the health tab hediff listing to be slightly less ugly and slightly more customisable.
            
                &lt;size=24&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
                   
                     - Customisability
                        - Body part replacement names (ex: peg legs, archotech eyes, Pawnmorpher morphs) get folded into the body part's name
                           - Multiple icons for various severities of bleeding and tending quality
                              - Merging hediffs by type rather than by label, treated and untreated hediffs share same entry
                                 - One icon per wound instead of vanilla's averaged single icon
                                    - Sorting hediffs for body part by severity
                                       - Per-body part health bars
                                          - Severity/Immunity progress bars
                                             - Expandable health tab size (yes, I &lt;b&gt;am&lt;/b&gt; aware of the irony of a mod called Compact Hediffs making the tab &lt;i&gt;larger&lt;/i&gt;)

            Allows you to build, mine, zone, etc. in various shapes. First select the task you want to do (build, mine, zone), then go into the shapes menu and select the shape. Use the rotate keys to rotate the shape. Use the F key (or the key you have bound to "forbid item") to toggle filling of corners. See mod setting for more.

These new countermeasures allow players to defend their homes in a variety of ways, using materials that aren't typically used by floor traps. Information on these new traps can be found below.

While it is waterproof and will remain sticky for a long time, the substance is also flammable.

When triggered, it creates a roaring fire and ignites adjacent chemfuel traps to create long walls of fire. Can be built next to each other. Cannot be uninstalled.

When triggered, the grenades will depin and scatter on the ground as the flashbang detonates and stuns those nearby. Highly effective and equally destructive.

               &lt;size=28&gt;Features&lt;/size&gt;
                  
                     Buildings using components will now gradually deteriorate. The odds of a breakdown happening (and requiring replacement components), is directly linked to the amount of deterioration.
                        
                           To keep your machinery in top shape, your colonists with the construction work enabled will periodically maintain components. As long as components are properly maintained, they cannot randomly break down.

                                       I'm very interested in any feedback on how these changes affect the difficulty of the game. I've tried to balance it so that it's not too hard/easy - but I'm just one person with one playstyle.

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Architect has been on my mind for a very long time. I always download every single mod adding new floors or fences, but I quickly become buried under all the new options, and eventually get pissed off because some of those options don't exactly fit Vanilla game in my eyes.
            	
               	I want new carpet colors, but I don't want all RGB hues - I want a small, tailored selection that fits the game. I want new tiles and floors, but I don't want 100 different patterns that have no distinction between them other than the looks. I want new fences, but I don't want more fence types than there are floor types. I want less, but I want more significant!
                  	
                     	Thus, Architect Expanded was born. Not only does it add new walls, fences, floors and carpets in various, vanilla-fitting colors, it also adds stone and metal bridges, as well as foundations that you can place on sand, so building in the desert will no longer be a problem! I seem to have forgotten to mention that wood now comes in 4 colors, all using just the base wood resource - so you can decide upon building what color your wooden objects will be!
                        	
                           	I really hope you will enjoy everything this mod has to offer, and it will allow you to make your colony at least twice as beautiful to look at.

            A common framework to change body part max HP. Mod version now provided via RimWorld's About.xml; older versions may still need to use HugsLib for this.
            
               This mod made use of the multi-version feature of RW, and therefore has compatibility with RW &lt; v1.5 in the same mod file.
                  
                     We strongly recommend you get a mod that alerts you about errors, e.g. Visible Error Logs.
                        
                           As a rule of thumb, if Ludeon did not change much about the health system, then this mod should still continue to work even though it may say "the version number does not match".

            Version 1.5.0
            
                       This mod force prisoners to work. To enable this feature prisoners must have "Force to work" option checked ("Prisoner" tab). Prison labor needs management that consist:
                          - Motivation - prisoners need to be motivated by presence of colonists. Wardens have new job - supervising prisoners. Low motivation can lead to revolts.
                             - Work assignment - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Work" tab.
                                - Time restrictions - prisoners that have option "Force to work" are added to "Restrict" tab.
                                   - Prison area - prisoners in order to work need to reach target. You can check "Hold open" option on doors. Be aware, they will try to run if they see opportunity.
                                      - "Prisoners only" tools - You can mark orders and bills by tools that exclude colonist from work.
                                 
                                            This is beta version. Some ascpects of mod still need to be balanced (like motivation). There can be still some bugs.

               I found it odd that prisoners could open doors when escaping when fleeing raiders cannot. 
                  So this mod makes prisoner having to bash doors when escaping as well.
                     
                        There is also a mod-option to allow prisoners to open cell-doors during a prison break but not other doors. This is to simulate that the prisoner have found a way to open the door and that is the start of the prison break.
                           
                              Since 1.3 added slaves the mod can be applied to rebelling slaves as well by enabling it in the mod-options.

               Escaping prisoners will now get fired upon by turrets. 
                  
                     Rebelling slaves will also be shot, selectable in the options.
                        There is also an option for shooting at slaves/prisoners in any aggro mental-state
                           Turrets can give terror to slaves to keep suppression levels.
                              Should work with all turrets unless they implement their own turret logic for finding targets.

                                                                                                      When original game code return that pawn does not have any body part for wearing boots or gloves (negative check), patch code starts and try to find any bionic body part on upper levels, like Bionic Arm or Bionic Leg. 
                                                                                                         If any bionic part exists in right place, patch change original result value to positive. And your pawn can continue wearing any gear on their hands, feet, etc...

Can you wear gloves on wooden hand? I think no. For balance purpose only. You can change settings of allowed replacement any time in mod settings. And yes, you can allow all replacement, if you want this. Reloading does not required.

Then other pawn do the same. And other. And other, but with gloves. What the hell. I tried to find a mod that could solve this problem. And... Did not find. I try to install something like [KV] Keep Hands and Feet - 1.1, but it not works. I don`t know why.
                                                                                                                                                                                                               Then same happens with Jewelry with bracelets and mood debuff... It was the last straw. That's why this mod exists.

                                                               Due to the incessant begging of their mortal pets - err, human allies - archotech AIs have developed modifications to the human brain that allow it limited psychic abilities. This power comes at a price, however, and accumulating too much psychic burnout can be deadly.

Well, it turns out that those psychically sensitive types aren't just useless liabilities after all! Psychic sensitivity affects outgoing powers just like incoming ones, meaning that your psychically hypersensitive colonist is much more likely to successfully Shock a raider, and her Unity will last longer.

If you want to do something more advanced, implementing the abstract class PsychicPowerDriver lets you run C# code when your power is used.

The coolers get more efficient in accordance with their price - though the default cooler will always be more resource and energy efficient. However, the bonuses are that you can do more with less space and don't need to worry about exhaust. In a space that's well insulated a non-prototype Quantum Cooler can be used to easily reach temperatures close to absolute zero.

            Researchable (RT Mods research tab) electric fuses to mitigate short circuits. When placed anywhere on a power network, each fuse will safely discharge up to three of network's batteries, mitigating or preventing the explosion.
            
               Does not require a new colony to add or remove (might throw a one-time error).

            Update of AKreedz mod
               https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1692393812
                  
                     A brief explanation of the mod as I understand it:
                         - New trait: Sword Master, low natural chance but automatically added when pawn has 20 in Melee
                            - Bullets can be rebounded as long as pawn has a Melee-weapon, but player-pawns must be drafted.
                               - Rebound-chance 0.5 * [Manipulation value, max 100%] * (Melee-skill / 10)
                                 	* Example - Manipulation-value: 105%, Melee-skill: 18
                                    		0.5 * 1 * 1.8 = 0.9 = 90% chance
                                        - Only projectiles that would have hit the pawn can be rebounded
                                           - Weapon has a chance to take durability-damage when rebounding
                                             	0.4 * (Melee-skill/5)
                                                 - At 1 durability the weapon is thrown to the ground to avoid getting destroyed
                                                    - Projectiles that are too fast cannot be rebounded, speed-limit can be changed in settings.
                                                      - Added support for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2451324814][SYR] Trait Value[/url]
                                                         - Traditional Chinese translation added, thanks shiuanyue!
                                                            - Added a setting to just block the projectiles
                                                               - Added setting for disabling automatically getting the rebound trait at melee skill 20
                                                                  - Added settings for the weapon-damage and base rebound-chance
                                                                     - Added CE-support
                                                                        - Any trait can be a rebound-trait by adding a mod-extension to it
                                                                           - Added setting to change the level where the trait is learned. Supports mods that increases the max-level of skills.

            Research Data is a lightweight research mod mostly using Rimworlds own mechanics. The mod aims to make researching a bit more interesting than just standing still behind the research bench. Collect research samples, create research papers and data, and add them to the research benched to start researching.

            Consider inventing the humble mini-turret.
            
               In vanilla Rimworld, the process is:
                      A colonist sits in front of a research table and stares at it for five weeks. 
                     
                        With Research Reinvented, the process can include any of the following:
                               Reverse engineer existing commandeered turrets.
                                  See what you can learn from that ancient broken down security turret.
                                     Analyse raw materials for their durability as turret armor.
                                        Experiment with steel to figure out efficient barrel replacements.
                                           Test out what modifications to the standard machine pistol or autopistol design might make for the best turret weapon.
                                              Construct a prototype turret, even if it takes longer and the end product might need some fixing up right away.
                                             	Ask allies to provide some of their expertise, or demand that information from your prisoners.
                                                	Brainstorm solutions during social encounters between your colonists.
                                                   
                                                      Taking advantage of such research opportunities can significantly accelerate your research progress. However, if none are available, the fallback Theory research is equivalent in speed to vanilla research (this speed can be lowered in the mod settings, if you'd prefer an incentive to seek opportunities out).

            Mod Version: 1.15.3\n\nRimHUD is a UI mod that displays detailed information about a selected character or creature. The HUD display is integrated into the inspect pane which can be resized to fit the additional information. Alternatively, the HUD can display a separate floating window and can be docked to any position on the screen.\n\nVisual warnings will appear if a pawn has any life-threatening conditions, has wounds that need tending to, or is close to a mental breakdown.

Roads cost more at higher elevation, starting from 1000m. Hills and swamps also have an effect, which can be checked when clicking on a site. When ISR2G is not used, the total cost can be further reduced from 100% down to 10% in the settings. Anything lower than 100% is probably quite unrealistic, but feel free to use the option.

            Your colonists can never be a true Rambo if they cannot gun while they are running. Therefore, this mod adds a mode that, when enabled, allows drafted colonists to shoot 
            while moving at the cost of an accuracy and movement penalty.These penalties can be modified in the mod settings of this mod. 
               Some things to take into account: 
                  - Fire at will should be enabled. Firing manually will cause the pawn to stop running. 
                     - RunAndGun mode can only be enabled when the pawn is drafted, and is carrying a ranged weapon in its hands. 
                        - The movement penalty is only applied at the moment the pawn is actually shooting or cooling down after shooting. So don't bother disabling RunAndGun every time you just want your pawn to walk somewhere.

                                    This mod depends on Hugslib, so make sure that mod loads before this mod does.

                                                This mod should be compatible with existing saves, and removing the mod from saves shouldn't introduce problems. Moreover, this mod should be compatible with most other mods (including Combat Extended). However, keep in mind that this is hard to test for me by myself, and this is the first release.
                                                   Therefore some issues regarding mod compatibility are bound to come up. Most issues that come up should be easy to fix, so please report any problems.

            Adds support for having sub-menus in float menus.
            
               This is intended as a library mod, allowing any mod developer to add sub-menus to their float menus.
                  
                     For players:
                        You only need this mod if another mod has a dependency on it.

            Adds a quick search field to any float menu that is at least a minimum size (configurable, default 15).
            
               Safe to add and remove at any time.
                  
                     Note for mod developers: 
                        The menu search field is available for modders through the Float Sub-Menus mod. This mod just adds it to menus that do not already have it.

            There are a lot of great features in the camera+, but I made this mod because of the performance issue. 
            You can modify the zoom range, zoom speed, smooth zoom settings, etc.
               If you want some more camera settings comment it!
                  
                     You can make camera follows your pawn. Default key is backspace and you can change it.
                        
                           This mod works same as changing camera settings at dev mod.
                              
                                 Do not use it with camera+ mode.

                                                                                 This mod adds climbable, sloped walls, also known as berms, that can be used in building strategic thresholds. If you're familiar with the Embrasures Mod, these are functionally the polar opposite of those. These walls block line of sight completely, and thus cannot be shot through, but they can still be climbed over rather easily. This allows you to create defensive thresholds, ambush zones for your melee fighters, control the range of engagement and much, much more. Also it's important to note that these walls do not mess with the enemy AI, and they are perfectly capable of traversing these walls despite lacking "line of sight", as long as they have a walkable path over the obstacle, they will behave normally. They do not support roofs, are slightly weaker than regular walls, cost 4 resources (all materials available to walls) and can be found under the Structures tab.

                                                                                             Walls: Less path cost and easier to walk over, can also be stood on. While standing on it, you must be near the edge of the wall to shoot off of it, however, edges provide no cover to those standing on them. There are no ranged bonuses from firing from a wall, other than having a safer and smoother retreat.

Cannot be stood on, therefore you must finish crossing it before you can take any offensive actions.

When this happens, some attackers will press on and climb the wall as is normaly expected, but some may stop moving forward until provoked in some way. This doesn't seem to always happen, as I have had 2 infestations climb the walls during their attack without problem, but during the most recent infestation, some of the insects seemed to bunch up in one of the corners of my chokepoint rather than climbing over the wall, and one spelopede even started attempting to dig through. This didn't affect every attacking insect but it affected a large number of them. Before doubling my wall, I was using a single thick wall for quite a while and that seemed to work fine without any issues, so just to be safe I would recommend only using a single thick wall when completely covering an entrance to avoid any AI pathing issues. In light of this, I have devised a sort of blueprint for using these in entrances safely without running any risk of AI confusion, please refer to the last image in the previews.

            The goal of this mod is to make fires more interesting and dynamic!
            
               For indoor fires, fires will grow and spread 2x faster (value adjustable in the options), which makes designing a base capable of containing indoor fires (such as with fire proof materials and fire extinguishing tools) a more important consideration.
                  
                     For outdoor fires, fire growth and spread will scale depending on a new value called "Map dryness".
                        
                           Right after rainfall fire growth and spread on outdoor objects will drop to 0%, making fires unable to grow or spread. But over time and highly dependent on the map's current temperature, that number will scale back up.
                              
                                 Because the rate at which the map dries depends on the temperature, summer will reclaim its throne as "fire season", while winter gives a short time to relax. Watch the world come alive, as the seasons and rain directly influence the outdoor fire risk!
                                    
                                       Jungle and swamp biomes will behave more realistically, no longer igniting into massive forest fires due to their high rainfall. While boreal, tundra, and the ice caps will behave more realistically too, where the low temperature means the wetness stays high despite low rainfall. But watch out if it's a scorching hot desert during a heat wave! (Evaporation rate adjustable in the options).
                                          
                                             Also allows the vanilla "Firewatcher" timer to be adjusted in the options, allowing time for forest fires to naturally burn instead of immediately triggering a rain upon any fire.

Firewatcher time is now configurable in the options, and triggers sooner than before. Default max fire rate is 200% for both indoor and outdoor, due to proliferation of fire weapons since Biology.

            Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories is a new installment in the Vanilla Expanded series. This time, our sight fell onto the accessories system, which is quite heavily limited in vanilla game. Smokepop belt, or Shield belt - these are your only choices. Are you rich enough to sport Royalty in your game? You MIGHT be able to build jet packs too! And Broadshield generators.
            
               Again, limited, isn’t it? Hence, we have decided it’s time to spice things up, and add some new equipment items for all technological eras of Rimworld - but as you all know, simply ‘adding X to Y skill’ isn’t the usual way we pick - therefor we tried to keep the bonuses and utility applications as varied as possible.
                  
                     Your tribal archers will now be twice as efficient with quivers, while your construction crews will carry belts with tools to speed up work. Your military commandos might find themselves a new shoulder mounted friend, and if you’re lucky and ballsy enough to do quests, a resurrector belt will literally stop your pawn from dying.
                        
                           Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Tribal is a new entry to Vanilla Weapons Expanded series aimed at introducing some new weapons New Tribe playing players can utilise for better defense capabilities. From light and heavy clubs, stone axes and throwing shards to slings and clay pots filled with chemfuel, tribal raids should become significantly more diverse now.

            The tribal faction is in a sorry state. In a world with either gun-toting, high tech, robotic, armored, or giant insect factions, it's a wonder the tribal faction has managed to survive at all.
            The goal of this mod was to make the tribals into an actual threat, having their own strengths and requiring some strategy to take down, but not overpowered. Please leave balance suggestions if you find them too strong or weak!
               
                  New Tribal War Plan:
                     1. Adds the Flame thrower, a grenadier unit equipped with "Molotov Cocktails" to flush out defenders from their positions.
                        2. Gives Breachers and Berserkers volcanic ash filled "Smoke bombs", to cover their advance amidst gunfire.
                           3. Gives Hunters, Heavy Archers, and Archer Chiefs modified "Flamebows" and "Great Flamebows", that can ignite both terrain and colonists.
                              4. Tweaked raid unit ratios for a more effective army composition.
                                 
                                    Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories Integration (If optionally installed):
                                       1. Gives tribal Breachers, Berserkers, and Chiefs "Battle banners" from "Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories" (If optionally installed).
                                          2. Gives all tribal Archers "Quivers" from "Vanilla Apparel Expanded - Accessories" (If optionally installed).
                                             
                                                New Item: Smoke Bomb (Usable by AI!)
                                                   Fine volcanic ash wrapped in a straw bundle. When smashed mid-air, it will release a small cloud of smoke, obscuring incoming shots and preventing turrets from locking on.
                                                      Cost: 10 Stone bricks
                                                         Cannot be refilled (1 charge)
                                                            Smaller radius than smokepop belts
                                                               
                                                                  New Item: Great Flamebow
                                                                     A greatbow equipped with incendiary arrows, which excels at dislodging defenders with its long range and high accuracy.
                                                                        Can ignite both terrain and colonists.
                                                                           
                                                                              Modified Item: Flamebow
                                                                                 Biotech's flamebow has been changed from AoE to single tile ignition and made usable by all tribes. Molotovs now fulfill the role of close range AoE fire threat, while the flamebows are meant for medium range high rate of fire.
                                                                                    Graphically upgraded to look cooler and easily distinguishable from standard bows.

Tribal units changed to use Molotovs instead of Fire Bombs.
                                                                                                                                                   ~ Changed graphic for the smoke bomb.

Fire bombs fulfill the role of the high priority AoE fire threat, while Flamebows are meant for long term sustained harassment. With the new tools available, flamebows also having AoE would be redundant and too powerful.
                                                                                                                                                                                    - Smoke bombs now have a 65% spawn chance up from 50%.

            Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Apparel is distributed into several new technologies that need to be researched, expanding the life of the game and possibly leading to some interesting choices - research a way to get off this planet? Or maybe learn how to craft jeans and workwear?
                  
                     This mod adds a wide selection of apparel with useful effects, including but not limited to:
                        Gas masks protecting from toxicity;
                           Jumpsuits and aprons for work speed boost;
                              Doctor scrubs and Chef’s uniforms.

            Vanilla Armour Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Apparel Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Armor is spread across several new technologies that need to be researched which in turn adds valuable game time before you achieve everything there is to achieve. New items cover all technological eras, from wooden armours of neolithic tribes, through chainmails and chestplates of medieval kingdoms, bulletproof vests and ghillie suits of the modern era combat all the way to two, brand new variants of a regular marine armor - one of them with an integrated ranged shield belt!

            Vanilla Base Generation Expanded is a mod many have been waiting for. Probably one of the most disappoint aspects of venturing out in a caravan in RimWorld is the fact that no matter where you go and no matter what base you raid, after you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Vanilla Bases tend to often resemble so called ‘20 granite door borg cube bases’.
            
               Kikohi set out on a mission to fix that, and with the help from our testing community, we have created a huge library of assets that the base will pull out of, procedurally generating unique villages, towns and megabases every time you visit a new location.
                  
                     The look of the bases and the assets use vary from faction to faction - tribal villages will have swathes of farmland around them, whilst pirate bases will be essentially bunkers with mortars and automatic defenses.

            Vanilla Brewing Expanded is an alcohol-oriented module in “Vanilla Cuisine Expanded” from the Vanilla Expanded team, notably Sarg Bjornson, Oskar Potocki and Chowder. Whilst other mods such as Vanilla Plants Expanded and Vanilla Fishing Expanded work well as standalone, due to technical limitations Vanilla Brewing Expanded requires the Core cooking mod.
            
               We made sure to keep the mechanics of this mod simple and intuitive without ruining the spirit of vanilla gameplay. All elements of this mod offer unique advantages and disadvantages, enhancing the depth of the game a thousandfold. With 7 unique, new alcohol types, you can now tailor your colonists’ drinking habits to your liking, with each alcohol having a unique production chain, buffs, downsides and uses.
                  
                     We strive to add unique elements for every single one of our players. A widely requested feature - tea and coffee, has also been added, allowing you to brew an immunity boosting hot tea, or whip out hot and iced coffees that help with staying awake and provide help against hypothermia and heat stroke respectively. Cigarettes and cigars also make an appearance, very addictive but incredibly helpful in stressful situations.

            Vanilla power generation is somewhat lackluster late game - Not only the game strongly encourages the use of solar panels and wind turbines as they provide significantly more energy at the cost of no fuel, but it also stops there - there is no technological progression in regards to power. Whether you’re an early industrial colony, or a spacer super-empire (and we all like to roleplay different ways), you’re bound to use the same power sources.
            
               Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Power module adds a plethora of new power sources, ranging all the way from small portable generators and large scale industrial ones, all the way to advanced spacer-tech green energy sources and a unique, and yet easy to understand nuclear generator. A selection of new batteries will help you with storing the power, whist the new utilities like a lightning rod and chemfuel pump will give you brand new ways of obtaining power and fuel.
                  
                     A new, vanilla-fitting energy chain has been added in the form of helixien gas - a combustible substance found mostly on the planets on the galaxy rim. It can be used to power a vast array of new gas-operated structures, making them completely immune from solar flares! Helixien gas can be stored in gas tanks for later use, uses a gas pipe system for connecting to structures and can easily be turned into electricity using gas-operated generators!

            Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a simple chain to extract Deepchem from the underground pockets and refine it into Chemfuel. It also adds storage solutions for both Deepchem and standard chemfuel, alongside a few structures including a Refinery and Chemfuel tap. Player can now connect any refuelable chemfuel-powered structures to the pipe network to make sure everything refuels automatically.
            	
               This mod is not trying to be better than other available chemfuel-related mods. Instead, it exists to showcase what our framework is capable of doing, and to provide an example for other modders what they can do if they choose to use Vanilla Expanded Framework. As a by-product, it's a vanilla-friendly mod that adds an infinite source of chemfuel provided that the player constructs the required infrastructure.

            Vanilla Events Expanded adds several new events to the game, all in line with vanilla events - nothing too drastic. A new tier of events is added - Purple events. Instead of having strict negative or positive effects, purple events force players to adapt as they last significantly longer than events like Toxic Fallout or Volcanic Winter.

            Deep Storage Units: yet another storage solution
            
               LWM presents a way to organize your supplies, loot, clothes, and even your garbage, to allow you a tidy base where your colonists aren't simply dumping stuff on the floor.  Deep Storage units include medicine cabinets, meat hooks, clothing racks, weapon lockers, etc, and all can store diverse items - just like regular shelves, but they allow more than one thing!
                  
                     ADDON MODS:
                         * Note: I have not used these, and have been super busy so haven't had a chance to add anything to the base mod. If you find right-clicking on storage slow, you might try this:
                            * A (faster?) UI for right-clicking on things: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169841018
                               * Little Storage 2, Vault, Simple Storage, etc - if you want more ways to store things, there are several available in the Steam workshop!
                                 
                                    FAQ / "I have a problem":
                                        * Meat Hooks require the Smithing research!
                                           * These Hampers are made of fabric, they don't hold fabric
                                              * Does it work with Vanilla shelves?
                                                 * You can always add more stored things in Mod Settings

                                                                                              * You can also change what's allowed in the Mod Settings!

            One of the first mods I ever came up with, and one that took the longest to design, draw, code and deliver, Vanilla Factions Expanded - Mechanoids is a mod unlike any other. A group of talented modders came together to make sure this mod is not only full of new interesting content, but also provides something to make the game a bit more dynamic.
            
               We have improved on the Custom Settlement Generation code to provide you with semi-random spaceships that Mechanoids can use to wreak havoc on the planet’s surface. Thanks to a lot of cooperation from some of the most famous modders out there, we were able to provide you with not just a new faction, but a unique mechanic of Total War, which makes the faction stronger the more ships land on the planet. We were also able to give you a little Factorio love letter in the form of fully automated machines that produce various items in the game, automatically. Did I mention it’s all happening automatically?
                  
                     New buildable mechanoids can fill various roles around your colony, from cleaning and hauling to base defense. With supercomputers, you can now automate research, Autosowers and Autoharvesters on the other hand will allow you to begin your farming enterprise with no need for physical labor.
                        
                           New quests, new events, new starting scenario, a storyteller, it’s all waiting for you. Merry Christmas!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production module, is an ideal mod to fill that late game hole in production. Once you set up your vanilla workstations with tool cabinets scattered everywhere, you essentially got as far as you possibly can. This carefully designed, vanilla-fitting mod adds a new layer to workstation layout, hopefully allowing players to create manufacturing-designated rooms instead of one massive room with all the workbenches.
            
               Linkables:
                  - Kitchen Sink Cabinet
                     - Tailor Cabinet
                        - Smithy Cabinet
                           - Machining Cabinet
                              - Drug Cabinet
                                 - Fabrication Cabinet
                                    
                                       Workbenches:
                                          - Component Bench 
                                             - Fueled Smelter
                                                - Electric Butcher
                                                   - Electric Drug Lab
                                                      - Electric Stonecutter

                                                               - Large Machining Table

            I have always found vanilla furniture to be lacking in depth and quantity. After researching Complex Furniture, the research tree for furniture pretty much ends, with a couple of odd technologies adding things like Vitals Monitors and Hospital Beds along the way. As part of the Vanilla Furniture Expanded mod, the team consisting of the Author of Android Tiers, Atlas, and me would like to add some sort of progression to the furniture of the rim, whilst also keeping it Vanilla friendly.

            We have all been there, with a colony of a hundred pawns where everyone looks somewhat the same. Starting colonists with no character to their looks. This mod is our attempt at fixing that.
            
               We have worked hard to create a hundred new hairstyles that fit vanilla RimWorld perfectly! From tribals to space refugees, every possible pawn receives a set of new, fitting styles that add much needed character and soul to them, and with so many new possibilities, it’s unlikely two of your pawns will look the same!
                  
                     And in case they do, one of our major features is a barber’s table - a workbench available to be built from the very start of the game, that allows you to change the hairstyle, colour and beard style of your pawns. Yes, you heard me right. We’re also adding 15 beards, which have a solid 20% chance to spawn on any male colonist! If, however, beards are not something you’re into, you can disable them in the mod settings!

            Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a rather simple chain, unlocked with Nutrient Paste research project, allowing the player to store nutrient paste in advance without the need for convoluted nutrient paste dispensers and hoppers. Players will now pipe nutrient paste directly from paste grinders into large storage vats. This can be connected to special output valves which serve prisoners and colonists with a not-so-tasty disgusting-looking stew.
            
               We are not removing the current nutrient paste dispenser or changing how it works - well, maybe a little change, but other than that this mod serves as new content, not changes to existing content.

            Vanilla Plants Expanded - Mushrooms is an optional module for Vanilla Plants Expanded adding a variety of new mushrooms. One common concern people have expressed is that being a tunneler - or simply living underground - prevents you from obtaining quite a lot of different, important resources.
            
               As such, we come to the rescue. A lot of these mushrooms will fill the empty holes in your tunneler colonies - you will now be able to produce medicine, wood, food, cloth, electricity, meat and even magic mushrooms underground!
                  
                     None of these mushrooms are inspired by real life mushrooms, but they are all really cool and I’m sure if you give them a chance, they will grow on you.

            Vanilla Storytellers Expanded is a brand new mod series featuring standalone storytellers, bringing new, unique mechanics to the game.
            
               “Perry Persistent conveys a story the same way he handles his investigations - with determination and attention to details.
                  
                     He will constantly keep you on your toes, as every day can bring you closer to the end of his investigation.“
                        
                           Perry Persistent comes with the following traits:
                              
                                 Large amount of events
                                    This storyteller will drastically increase the amount of events, to the point where new events will keep happening almost every day, constantly keeping you on your toes. In addition to that, faction quests will also be given to you on a regular basis.
                                       
                                          Population doubled
                                             This storyteller allows for double the usual population. This means that the game will be somewhat more friendly until you hit a very big colony size.
                                                
                                                   Man in the Coat
                                                      In addition to the Man in Black, a very rare Man in the Coat can arrive to complete his investigation. Man in the Coat brings a more powerful gun than the Man in Black.

            Introducing "Vanilla Temperature Expanded," a mod that adds a detailed and controllable central heating system to your game. This mod brings in a new feature called Efficiency, which affects how well your heating system runs. It's all about giving you more control over the temperature in your colony.
            
               You'll find new research options that lead you to better ways of managing temperature, creating a more engaging gameplay experience. The mod includes various components like air ducts, AC units, and compressors that you can connect to manage your air conditioning system efficiently.
                  
                     We've also added a new mechanic, AC Efficiency, to keep things interesting. It's a simple concept: the more devices you connect, the more your efficiency might drop, affecting power use. But you can balance things out with the right setup and planning.
                        
                           There are lots of new structures to play with, such as industrial coolers, heaters, wall-mounted units, and ceiling fans, giving you plenty of options for controlling your environment's temperature.
                              
                                 "Vanilla Temperature Expanded" is designed to enhance your game by making temperature management more interactive and fun, without complicating things too much. If you're interested in adding more depth to your game's temperature system, give this mod a try!

Not only that, but you can also swap the graphic of the building on command, allowing you to mix and match styles to properly decorate your base.
                  
                     The mod includes more than 150 new random building graphics for 35 vanilla buildings.

            After the success of our Vanilla Factions Expanded - Medieval, which was a faction mod closing the gap between tribal faction and outlander faction, we have begun work on another faction mod - this time adding frontier settlers, inspired by western films. The scope of this mod is quite similar to our Medieval mod, so you can expect it to be a well fitting mini-expansion.
            
               Thanks to Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers, you can experience the harsh reality of being a gang of bandits on the rimworld frontier. Settlements of this faction are built in the same way they were in frontier America - with a main road separating a town into two parts. Thanks to new outfits and headgear, as well as several new weapons, your colonists will be able to blend in perfectly alongside all those thugs and prospectors shooting each other on the streets and drinking chemshine - a new, highly volatile chemfuel distilled alcohol. A large amount of new chemfuel-themed structures allow you to witness the power of combustible fuel, making your bases look just like the wild west settlements! A new starting scenario allows you to play bandits, a faction hostile to every other civilisation on the planet, and with new world quests you can become a bounty hunter or a caravan raider! Sorry, no stagecoach robbery included!
                  
                     A new storyteller, Diego Dire, would like to tell you a story that begins with the blaze of glory. Not only will he provide you with more western-style events than regular, vanilla events, he will also scale backwards - meaning the beginning will be difficult, but it will slowly become more and more friendly. That is, of course, until Diego decides to start the cycle all over again, throwing the worst of the worst at you. Can you handle the challenge?
                        
                           With a native support for the other Vanilla Expanded mods, settlers will come equipped with Vanilla Apparel Expanded clothing, whilst thanks to Vanilla Weapons Expanded, bandits will start using lever action rifles and sawed-off shotguns!
                              
                                 And watch out for drunk muffalos. Those beasts love chemshine!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Coilguns is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of spacer-tech weapons, fully craftable upon researching mass drivers technology. Coilguns come with a unique gimmick - whilst their firing speed and aiming time are quite unforgiving, projectiles fires from these weapons pierce any target they hit - flesh or metal, as well as any obstacles. Each obstacle reduces damage dealt to the next unlucky object/creature, but effectively these weapons allow your colonists to score multi-kills with a single shot.
            
               Shots fired by these weapons cannot penetrate mountains or reinforced walls from Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Spacer.
                  
                     Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.
            
               Weapons are spread across the technology tree allowing for realistic and time-consuming progression, making the higher-tech weapons even more rewarding. Bear in mind, however, that all weapons are perfectly balanced in line with Vanilla weapons, which means that a Battle Rifle added by this mod might not necessarily be better than a standard assault rifle in some situations.

            What I think this game was missing from the usual combat encounters is a punch, a smell of freshly fired bolters, the heat of an autocannon barrel and the look of surprise on the enemy faces as 10 homing missiles decimate their ranks. Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Heavy is our response to that task: This mod adds incredibly heavy weapons that can only be equipped on a handful of pawns - be it power armored troopers, pawns with a Tough trait or soldiers wearing our new industrial tech exosuits.
            
               These weapons utilise the limited-use code, just like vanilla triple rocket launcher, except they can be fired more than once. After the weapon depletes, it breaks, which means you need to simply craft a new one. No ammo system, nothing like that!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser is an addition to one of the most popular mods of Vanilla Expanded collection - Vanilla Weapons Expanded, however it can be played without it. This mod adds a selection of ultratech weapons, with a small number of them craftable, whilst keeping the majority of them only obtainable from the enemy drops, world quests and traders. Laser weapons introduce a new projectile type - a laser beam that has a slight chance of setting the enemy on fire. These weapons have high armour piercing and are extremely effective in combat against armored enemies and mechanoids.
            
               Salvaged Laser weapons are obtainable by players using a new Salvage laser weapon recipe, which uses intellectual skill of pawns and allows them to look through advanced components to come up with a random laser weapon. Salvaged laser weapons are less accurate than their state-of-the-art ultratech counterparts, and are more prone to overheating.
                  
                     Laser weapons have a brand new warm-up mechanic making them perfect for defensive battles - the longer your pawn is stationary whilst firing, the faster the weapon can fire. Once it reaches maximum firing speed however, it can overheat, causing a small explosion with a chance of setting your pawn on fire.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Quickdraw is an addition to a popular Vanilla Expanded mod series, adding four new quickdraw weapons. These firearms allow you to quickly respond to sudden enemy encounters, as special plasteel alloys allow you to reduce the aiming time to zero. There are drawbacks however - whilst these weapons fire a little bit faster than their vanilla counterparts, the cooldown after firing the shots is slightly increased.

            One of the most commonly requested features for Vanilla Factions Expanded - Settlers was tech-locking their weapons. Sadly, vanilla game does not differentiate between ‘western-style’ weapons like revolvers and M14 assault rifles - for the game, it’s all industrial weapons. If we were to white list only ‘western-style’ weapons, it wouldn’t offer enough variety - you’d constantly see raiders with revolvers, bolt action rifles and pump shotguns. That’s it. Boring isn’t it?
            
               Don’t worry fam, we got you. Hold our beer while we deliver a decent-sized weapon mod featuring vast amount of new western-style weapons with a new High roller mechanic, giving these guns a chance (10%) to deal double damage. This mod also includes a large number of conditional patches adding even more weapons - if you’re running Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Laser, you can expect some laser frontier weapons, with Heavy Weapons you can hold a gatling gun, with Coilguns you can have proper coilgun revolver and repeater, and with quickdraw you can wield a famous derringer!

            With a brand new utility item code introduced in RimWorld 1.2 update, I saw it as a perfect fit to make grenades be actually useful instead of forcing you to choose between a grenade and a rifle. By crafting grenade belts, you can now equip all vanilla and vanilla expanded grenade types on your pawn alongside any weapon you wish, and use them manually by selecting a special “throw grenade” button on the menu, next to the draft button.
            
               You heard it right, now you can launch grenades and continue to fire your assault carbine at your enemies! No need to call out that single useless colonist that always carries just grenades.
                  
                     What’s the drawback? Grenades on the belt are limited, much like the ammo for the Grenadier suit in Royalty DLC, you now need to refill the grenades after the charges deplete. You refill them using the grenade type they are made out of - Frag grenade belt gets refilled with frag grenades etc.

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Makeshift is a small module that fits perfectly with all the nutters playing Naked Brutality survival scenario, or roleplaying in a post-apocalyptic universe. Inspired directly by games like Rust and Fallout, as well as the improvised firearms of the Chechen rebels, these guns can be crafted without any machining tables or steel. All you need is to complete the Makeshift weapons research project, bring your components to a crafting spot and start mass producing these cheap, unreliable weapons.
              
               That’s right. Unreliable? What does it mean? It means that each weapon has a random amount of shots it can fire within a burst (with a minimum and maximum amount). A makeshift pistol can fire between 0 (!) and 1 shots, whilst a makeshift rifle can fire anywhere between 0 and 5 shots.
                  
                     You never know how many shots your burst will fire, or if it will fire at all, thus making these weapons non-ideal. Essentially, by crafting these, you allow Randy Random to mess with you one more time during every combat encounter. But hey, they are cheap, and they are makeshift!

            Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Non-Lethal has been a commonly requested weapon set. So many times prison breaks result in accidental deaths. So many times, an enemy raider is your colonist’s father and you accidentally put a sniper rifle round through his skull. So many times your berserk pawn starts to fight with your melee expert with archotech arms, resulting in, well, death.
            
               Thanks to this mod, you will now have numerous ways of dispatching crowds and taking down single targets - you can use tear gas to blind groups of opponents, tasers to stun single targets, and dart guns to bring down even the hardest foes in a matter of seconds.

                                          - Before a fight you are encouraged to recall the robots so they don't accidently wander into the fight area.

            &lt;b&gt;Opportunistic hauling. Haul-to-inventory improvements (only if &lt;color=grey&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pick Up And Haul&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/color&gt; is installed).&lt;/b&gt;
            A must-have with PUAH. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.
               
                  The following description is for RimWorld &lt;b&gt;1.5&lt;/b&gt;.
                     
                        
                           Much of this mod is improving &lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul&lt;/i&gt; (optional; installed separately). If you already use PUAH, you want this mod too.
                              
                                 "But my pawns are walking farther!"
                                    Yes. A slightly longer journey now to avoid a &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; longer journey next time.
                                       
                                          &lt;color=teal&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul+&lt;/i&gt;: Better unloading&lt;/color&gt;
                                             We enhance all inventory hauling by unloading only once at each storage destination, in closest order.
                                                We cache haulable destinations to improve performance.
                                                   
                                                      &lt;color=teal&gt;Opportunistic hauls&lt;/color&gt;
                                                         Vanilla has support for opportunities, but with limitations: haulable near your &lt;b&gt;start&lt;/b&gt; position, and storage near your job.
                                                            We prefer these, but drop them as requirements to include hauls along the path.
                                                               
                                                                  We skip opportunities when bleeding or forming a caravan.
                                                                     
                                                                        &lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul+&lt;/i&gt;
                                                                           Modified to grab only surrounding things whose unload path is also opportunistic.
                                                                              
                                                                                 &lt;color=teal&gt;Haul extra supplies &amp; ingredients closer&lt;/color&gt;
                                                                                    If hauling resources to storage would bring them closer to their job, do that first (grabbing extra).
                                                                                       
                                                                                          &lt;i&gt;Pick Up And Haul+&lt;/i&gt;
                                                                                             Modified to grab extra things headed to the same storage (when higher priority) unless bleeding.
                                                                                                Grab extra supplies &amp; ingredients headed to the same storage (when equal priority).
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                      &lt;color=teal&gt;Storage building filters for mod compatibility&lt;/color&gt;
                                                                                                         Permit or deny for any storage building through settings, or leave automatically managed with mod updates.

            Adds more cinematic effects to ranged weapons:
            - long trails for projectiles
               - weapon animations for miniguns and bows
                  - projectiles comes from thew barrel of the gun and not from inside of the colonist.
                     - weapon movement animation for pawns missing their targets
                        - different sounds for some weapons
                           - visual effects for particle collision
                              - faster projectile speed for all projectiles
                                 
                                    You can choose which changes you want in mod settings.

                           [h2]Changes from 1.5[/h2]
                              The advanced animations have been removed from the mod, if you want these animations you can add [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877292196]Yayo's Animation[/url] as it already does the same animations.
                                 
                                    - Fixed the missing config-text
                                       - Added in the various fixes XT-0xFF and PrincessOfEvil in the [url=https://github.com/Ogliss/Yayos-Combat-3/tree/Dev-1.3]dev-branch[/url] of the original git-repository
                                          - If [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2944488802]Melee Animation[/url] is loaded the advanced animations is only used for ranged weapons
                                             - A big thanks to Ferris that made most of the work for the 1.5 update, without them this would have taken a lot longer!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming module is a great way to boost the efficiency of your colonies when it comes to providing food on the table. With a plethora of new hydroponics - one for early game and one for late game, you can really witness the technological progression of your colony - and gain more enjoyment from the game itself.
            
               A very popular request on all suggestion threads on RimWorld Ludeon forums is draggable hydroponics - at this point I believe it’s my duty to deliver, hence all three kinds of hydroponics now have a draggable version! Make it any shape you want!
                  
                     New structures by the likes of animal feeder, a sprinkler and a scarecrow have been added, each with unique code to make them feel more authentic. The scarecrow will actually make animals flee, hence stopping them from devouring all your precious potatoes!

            Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Security module is a result of hours upon hours of hard work. It has been a long time since we began working on this mod, and with a team of brilliant programmers, I am not honored to present to you a Vanilla Expanded approach to base defenses. Every word and every stat in this mod have been carefully prepared to be as balanced and as “vanilla” as possible. 
            
               This module introduces 27 new defense structures, all neatly filling up the Security tab in the Architect menu. With research technologies spread out across all stages of the game, this mod itself is enough to provide you with hours of entertainment.

                                                                                          	- how to get: kill mechs, get mech oil from them(sideproduct of disassembly), distille it to raw luciferium batches, make luciferium with neutroamine at druglab
                                                                                             	- can build a stasis pod to extract mech oil

                                                                                                                        the recipes to get mechanite oil from downed mechanoids is not researched locked (skill lock with 10 crafting still), so its not so much rng dependent. you get 1 oil form all mechs. the process kills them and is always sucess full. since you need downed enemys and thats already random. you can find a dragable order to easier asign the recipe to downed mechs in your orders category (should be near the end). This will assign the correct recipe to scythers/centipedes. All colonists performing tasks on mechanoids need the construction skill enabled. This is "locked" in the base games code and has nothing to do with this mod specifily.
                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                              you can build the distillerys after the research. same temperature range as beer barrels to keep them running, just needs 5 days tho. and only 10 oil, to make 5 raw luciferium batches. they need power to run (100). with the raw luciferium batch and neutroamine (each 10) you can craft 5 pills of luciferium. so basiclly 2x distillery to get a "full" recipe. the recipe need a pawn with 7 medicine to craft. it trains medicine.
                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    the mechanite stasis pod needs 20 mechanite oil and 1 mechcorpse (besides the normal steel/component stuff). the mech corpse needs to be prepared at the machining table to be used to build the pod (use scyther or centipded corpse). prepared mechanoid corpsed can be traded and disassembled again, you will lose out on materials. compared to disassembling a mechanoid direct. just to prevent filling storage and maybe a way to buy them from exotic goods traders and get materials.

            RocketMan:
            
               NOTE: HugsLib is no longer required for RimWorld 1.4, 1.3.
                  
                     RocketMan is mod that is designed to improve RimWorld Performance.
                        
                           Important note: RocketMan should be the last mod in your mod list.
                              
                                 1- RocketMan doesn't support RimThreaded and never will.
                                    2- Bug reports with no logs will not get a response.
